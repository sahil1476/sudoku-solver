# sudoku-solver
This project is based on the sudoku solver. An insight view of the 
project will encompass â€“ what it is all about, what it aims to achieve, 
what is its purpose and scope and how it can be used. In this report, I 
presented a detailed implementation of sudoku. The sudoku game 
consists of graphical user interface, solver. The solver and generator is 
implemented using efficient algorithm. The solver finds the solution to 
the puzzles entered by the user. This project gives an insight in to the 
different aspects of Data Structure and programming
